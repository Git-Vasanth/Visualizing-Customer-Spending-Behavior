# Visualizing Customer Spending Behavior

## Objective
The goal of this Power BI project is to analyze customer spending behavior over time, focusing on Average Order Value (AOV) trends. This analysis will help the Head of Sales Strategy gain insights into how transaction values fluctuate, identify key periods of increased spending, and assess the impact of marketing campaigns and product launches on customer purchases.

## Key Insights
### 1. Monthly AOV Trends
- The analysis tracks how the AOV changes month over month.
- This helps in identifying consistent spending patterns or irregular fluctuations.

### 2. AOV Spikes and Seasonality
- Specific months with unusually high AOV are highlighted.
- This can indicate seasonal impacts, promotional effects, or external factors influencing customer spending.

### 3. Impact of Marketing Campaigns
- By correlating AOV trends with marketing campaign timelines, the effectiveness of different promotional strategies can be assessed.
- **Example:** Comparing AOV before, during, and after a campaign to see its influence on spending.

### 4. Effect of Product Launches
- Evaluates changes in AOV following new product releases.
- Helps determine whether new offerings increase transaction values.

### 5. Visual Representation
- Power BI dashboards include line charts, bar graphs, and KPI cards to present trends in an intuitive and interactive way.
- This facilitates data-driven discussions and strategy planning.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes key attributes such as:
- **Date** of transaction
- **Customer ID** to track purchasing habits
- **Order ID & Order Amount** to calculate AOV
- **Marketing Campaigns & Product Launches** for correlation analysis
- **City & Payment Method** for demographic insights
- **Customer Segment** (Loyal, Regular, High-Value, New) to differentiate spending behavior
- **Sales Representative & Discounts Applied** to assess sales influence

## Power BI Capabilities
Power BI is used for:
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Importing raw data, handling missing values, and structuring it for analysis using Power Query.
- **Data Modeling:** Creating relationships between tables and defining calculated measures.
- **Visualization:** Building interactive reports and dashboards using various Power BI visuals such as:
  - Line Charts for AOV trends
  - Heat Maps to highlight high-spending periods
  - Filters and slicers for dynamic exploration of customer segments, locations, and campaigns
- **DAX Calculations:** Implementing formulas for custom metrics like moving averages, YoY percentage changes, and correlation coefficients.

## Business Value
This analysis provides actionable insights to:
- Optimize marketing strategies by focusing on effective campaigns.
- Adjust pricing models based on seasonal trends and customer spending behaviors.
- Enhance product launch planning by evaluating post-launch spending patterns.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Power BI, the Head of Sales Strategy can gain a deeper understanding of customer spending habits, refine sales tactics, and drive revenue growth through data-driven decisions.
